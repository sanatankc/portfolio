- *Hired and mentored a remote intern team* to develop a cross-platform frontend monorepo (Next.js, React Native & tRPC), balancing high craft with rapid MVP delivery.
- *Built an end-to-end ETL pipeline* using *Stagehand* & *Crawl4AI* to crawl 100K+ DIY projects and third-party assets in order to feed clean, structured data into downstream AI pipelines.
- *Engineered multi-stage AI workflows* to enforce quality/reproducibility checks, process 500K+ images, extract component metadata and generate detailed, image-rich build guides using *Goose* and *Langchain*.
- *Created “Goose”*, a type-safe, event-driven AI workflow library with built-in context management and built an internal dashboard to orchestrate, monitor and iterate LLM workflows.
- *Engineered an embedding-based recommender system* that leverages OpenAI embeddings and Pinecone to match users with projects via AI-generated and user-selected onboarding tags.
